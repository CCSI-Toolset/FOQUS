This test may be run as a Visual Studio SimSinter test, or by Console Sinter.

In Visual Studio it is called SinterGPROMSTest and is found in the SinterConsumerTests.cs

With ConsoleSinter just run:

ConsoleSinter.exe .\BufferTank_FO.json .\BufferTank_inputs.json Output.json

This will produce an output file called Output.json that should match "Good_Output.json"
