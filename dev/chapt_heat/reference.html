<p>The Heat Integration Node performs heat integration calculations for the
entire process in the meta-flowsheet. This node transfers simulation
results to a GAMS-based heat integration program, solves the program,
and transfers part of important heat integration results from GAMS to
the graphical interface. The detailed heat integration results can be
found in \gamsHeatIntegration.lst. All input and output variables in
the nodes connected to the Heat Integration Node (with the edge pointing
to the heat integration node) are automatically transferred to heat
integration. However, only the variables with heat integration tags are
considered and processed in heat integration. Heat integration tags are
described in the Heat Integration Tutorial in Section
<a class="reference external" href="#sec.hi.tut">[sec.hi.tut]</a>.</p>
<p>The Heat Integration Node Editor widget is illustrated in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#heat.int.inputs">[heat.int.inputs]</a> and Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#heat.int.outputs">[heat.int.outputs]</a>. To specify a node as a Heat
Integration Node, expand the <strong>Model</strong> section, expand the <strong>Model</strong>
drop-down list, and then select “heat_integration.” Some input variables
control the performance of heat integration. Output variables display
heat integration results, which are used as final results or inputs for
steam cycle calculations.</p>

<img alt="Heat Integration Node Editor (Input Variables)" src="../_images/heat_int_inputs.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Heat Integration Node Editor (Input Variables)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The Heat Integration Node <strong>Input Variables</strong> are listed below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Exchanger minimum approach temperature (<strong>EMAT</strong>) is the minimum
temperature difference between hot streams and cold streams for heat
exchanger area calculations. The value of EMAT is usually not larger
than that of HRAT (see below). The default value of EMAT is set to
5K. When a small value of HRAT is chosen (e.g., 3-5K), the value of
EMAT should also be small (e.g., 1-3K).</li>
<li>Heat recovery approach temperature (<strong>HRAT</strong>) is the minimum
temperature difference between hot streams and cold streams for
utility consumption calculations. Smaller HRAT usually leads to lower
utility consumptions but higher capital cost of the heat exchanger
network. An appropriate value should be selected for HRAT in order to
achieve the best economic performance. The typical value of HRAT in
industrial applications is 10K, which is also the default value of
HRAT. The user may choose other HRAT values depending on their
applications (e.g., in power plants, HRAT can be as low as 3-5K for
higher heat recovery).</li>
<li><strong>Life.Plant</strong> is the operating life of the plant. The default value
is 20 years. The user can change the value depending on detailed
applications.</li>
<li><strong>Net.Power</strong> is the net power output of a power plant without carbon
capture and storage (CCS). This is an optional input variable;
therefore, it has no default value. The user only needs to assign a
value to it when the steam cycle node is also present in the
flowsheet. The net power output is used to calculate the amount of
heat recovered for steam cycle via the heat exchanger network.</li>
<li><strong>No.Stream</strong> is the number of process streams (for heat integration)
in the plant. This is an optional input variable without default
value. When the value of “No.Stream” is not assigned, the number of
process streams is calculated by the Python program via heat
integration tags (see the Heat Integration Tutorial in Section
<a class="reference external" href="#sec.hi.tut">[sec.hi.tut]</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Operation.Hours</strong> is the annual operational hours of the plant. For
power, refinery, and chemical industries, the typical value is
7500-8500 hours. The default value here is 8000 hours.</li>
<li><strong>ROR</strong> is the rate of return for the project. The default value is
10 percent. The user should select appropriate values for ROR based
on their own projects. The variables <strong>Life.Plant</strong>, <strong>No.Stream</strong>,
<strong>Operation.Hours</strong>, and <strong>ROR</strong> are used for the cost calculation.</li>
</ul>

<img alt="Heat Integration Node Editor (Output Variables)" src="../_images/heat_int_outputs.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Heat Integration Node Editor (Output Variables)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>Output Variables</strong> of the Heat Integration Node are listed below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Capital.Cost</strong> is the minimum approximated capital cost for the
heat exchanger network (in million U.S. dollars). The capital cost is
calculated from the heat exchanger area (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Cooling.Water.Consumption</strong> is the minimum cooling water
consumption rate (represented by energy rate GJ/hr) predicted by heat
integration. Cooling water is an outside utility with the temperature
of 20°C.</li>
<li><strong>FH.Heat.Addition</strong> is the amount of heat recovered to feed water
heaters in the steam cycle. This variable is only valid when steam
cycle calculations are also presented. If more heat is added to the
steam cycle, higher net power output is expected. The value of
“FH.Heat.Addition” is a vector with five elements. The first to fifth
element of the vector represents the amount of heat added to the
first-stage to the fifth-stage of the feed water heater in the steam
cycle. The temperature of the feed water increases from the
first-stage to the fifth-stage; therefore, heat added to the feed
water heaters achieves a higher efficiency power generation from the
first-stage to the fifth-stage heater. The temperature range for the
five feed water heaters are 34-65°C, 65-96°C, 96-128°C, 128-160°C,
and 160-195°C. These values are obtained from a supercritical power
plant simulation model in Thermoflex.</li>
<li><strong>Heat.Exchanger.Area</strong> is the minimum heat exchanger area (in square
meters), which is used for the capital cost calculation.</li>
<li><strong>IP_Steam.Consumption</strong> is the minimum intermediate-pressure steam
consumption rate (in GJ/hr). Note: Both intermediate- and
low-pressure steam are treated as a utility in heat integration
calculations here; however, they are actually extracted from the
steam cycle in the power plant. Therefore, minimizing steam
consumption is equivalent to maximizing the net power output.
Intermediate-pressure steam is extracted from the crossover of the
pressurized intermediate-pressure turbine (PIPT) and the
intermediate-pressure turbine (IPT) with the temperature of 230°C.</li>
<li><strong>LP_Steam.Consumption</strong> is the minimum low-pressure steam
consumption rate (in GJ/hr). Low-pressure steam is extracted from the
crossover of IPT and low-pressure steam turbine (LPT) with the
temperature of 164°C.</li>
<li><strong>Total.Cost</strong> is the minimum approximated total annualized cost for
the heat exchanger network (in million U.S. dollars per year), which
equals the sum of utility cost and annualized capital cost.</li>
<li><strong>Utility.Cost</strong> is the minimum utility cost (in million U.S. dollars
per year), which equals the sum of the cost of cooling water,
intermediate-pressure steam, and low-pressure steam. It can also be
treated as scaled total utility consumption where the consumption
rate of each utility is weighted by its cost.</li>

<h2>Steam Cycle<a class="headerlink" href="#steam-cycle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Steam Cycle Node performs steam cycle and power output calculations
for a power plant with CCS (and possibly heat integration). Correlations
for net power output with steam extraction and heat addition to feed
water heaters, which are obtained from a supercritical power plant model
in Thermoflex, are utilized to calculate net power output and net
efficiency with CCS in the Steam Cycle Node. These correlations are
currently hard coded in Python for this node. The users will have a
choice to provide their own correlations in future versions of FOQUS.</p>
<p>The Steam Cycle Node Editor widget is illustrated in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#steam.cycle.inputs">[steam.cycle.inputs]</a> and Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#steam.cycle.outputs">[steam.cycle.outputs]</a>.</p>
<p>To specify a node as a Steam Cycle Node, expand the <strong>Model</strong> section,
click on the <strong>Model</strong> drop-down list, and then select “steam_cycle.”
All input variables (potentially) can be contributed to power output
calculations; however, not all input variables are required to have a
value assigned, except net power output and net efficiency without CCS.
Output variables describe effects of CCS and heat integration to net
power output and net efficiency.</p>
<div class="figure" id="steam-cycle-inputs">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Steam Cycle Node Editor (Input Variables)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>Input Variables</strong> of the Steam Cycle Node are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Electricity.Consumption</strong> is the total electricity consumption in
all processes other than steam cycle. The input value of this
variable can be provided by the user or transferred from simulation
outputs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>FH.Heat.Addition</strong> is the amount of heat recovered to feed water
heaters in steam cycle. The input value of this variable can be
transferred from heat integration output.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>IP_Steam.Consumption</strong> is the intermediate-pressure steam
consumption rate in heat exchangers. It is usually provided by heat
integration, and sometimes it can be directly provided by simulation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>IP_Steam.Injection</strong> is the intermediate-pressure steam injection
rate to process streams. In some equipment, such as regenerators in
the capture process, steam needs to be injected directly into the
input stream to provide a large amount of heat and realize fast heat
transfer. The steam injection rate is different from the steam
consumption rate as it does not need heat exchangers and is not
considered in heat integration. This variable is typically provided
by simulation output.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>LP_Steam.Consumption</strong> is the low-pressure steam consumption rate
in heat exchangers provided by heat integration or simulation output.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>LP_Steam.Injection</strong> is the low-pressure steam injection rate to
process</div>
<div class="line">streams provided by simulation output.</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Net.Efficiency</strong> is the net efficiency of the power plant without
CCS. Its default value is 42.06 percent, which is the efficiency of a
typical supercritical pulverized coal-fired power plant without CCS.
The user should change the value when another type of power plant is
applied.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Net.Power</strong> is the net power output of a power plant without CCS.
The user must give an input to this variable to perform steam cycle
calculations. Both <strong>Net.Efficiency</strong> and <strong>Net.Power</strong> provide base
case values for a power plant without CCS and heat integration.</p>
</li>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Steam Cycle Node Editor (Output Variables)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>Output Variables</strong> of the Steam Cycle Node are listed below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Delta.Efficiency.CCS</strong> is the change of the net efficiency of a
power plant with CCS compared to the base case value. This variable
is expected to be negative since CCS decreases the net power output
to a certain degree.</li>
<li><strong>Delta.Efficiency.HI</strong> is the change of the net efficiency of a
power plant with heat integration compared to the base case value.
This variable is expected to be positive since heat integration
potentially increases the net power output.</li>
<li><strong>Delta.Power.CCS</strong> is the change of the net power output of a power
plant with CCS compared to the base case value.</li>
<li><strong>Delta.Power.HI</strong> is the change of the net power output of a power
plant with CCS compared to the base case value.</li>
<li><strong>Net.Efficiency.CCS</strong> is the net efficiency of the power plant with
CCS given the base case value.</li>
<li><strong>Net.Power.CCS</strong> is the net power output of the power plant with CCS
assigned as the base case value.</li>
