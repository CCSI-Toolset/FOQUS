Microsoft Excel Configuration
=============================

#. The “SinterConfigGUI” can be launched from FOQUS, via the
   **Create/Edit** button found in **File**\ :math:`\rightarrow`
   **Add/Update Model to Turbine** or “SinterConfigGUI” may be run on
   its own by selecting **CCSI Tools** :math:`\rightarrow` **FOQUS**
   :math:`\rightarrow` **SinterConfigGUI** from the Start menu.

#. The splash window displays, as shown in Figure
   :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.splash`. The user may
   click the splash screen to proceed, or wait 10 seconds for it to
   close automatically.

#. The SinterConfigGUI Open Simulation window displays (Figure
   :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.openpage`). If
   “SinterConfigGUI” was opened from FOQUS, the filename text box
   already contains the correct file. To proceed immediately click
   **Open File and Configure Variables** or click **Browse** to search
   for the file. For this tutorial, a fresh copy of the BMI test is
   opened. It can be found at:

   C:\SimSinterFiles\\ Excel_Install_Test\exceltest.xlsm.

#. Microsoft Excel starts in the background. This is so the user can
   observe things about the worksheet while working on the configuration
   file.

#. In the “SinterConfigGUI” the SinterConfigGUI Simulation Meta-Data
   page is now displayed (Figure :ref:`fig.sinter.excel.savename`). The
   first and most important piece of metadata is **Save Location** at
   the top of the window. This is where the sinter configuration file is
   saved. The system attempts to locate a reasonable file location and
   file name; however, the user must confirm the correct file location,
   since it automatically overwrites whatever filename currently exists.

#. Continue to complete in the remaining fields and click **Next**.

#. In the SinterConfigGUI Variable Configuration Page, (Figure
   :ref:`fig.sinter.excel.variableempty`)
   notice that the Excel setting variable **macro** is already included
   in the **Selected Input Variables.** If the Excel spreadsheet has a
   macro that should be run after SimSinter sets the inputs, but before
   SimSinter gets the outputs, enter the macros name in the **Name**
   text box. If the default is left blank, no macro is run (unless a
   name is supplied in the input variables when running the simulation).

#. The Excel simulation has the same **Variable Tree** structure as
   Aspen Plus, as shown in (Figure
   :ref:`fig.sinter.excel.variableselected`).
   Only the variables in the active section of the Excel spreadsheet
   appear in the **Variable Tree**. If, for some reason, a cell does not
   appear the in tree, the user may manually enter the cell into the
   **Selected Path** text box. In this case, select the “height$C$4”
   variable.

   Note: Row is first in the **Variable Tree**, yet column is first in
   the **Path**.

#. If the user double-clicks, presses enter, clicks **Preview**, or
   clicks **Lookup**, the variable will be displayed in the **Preview
   Variable** frame. Click the **Make Input** button to make the
   variable an input variable. Now the variable is in the **Selected
   Input Variables** section, and its meta-data may be edited (Figure
   :ref:`fig.sinter.excel.variableinputs`).

#. Enter an output variable (such as, “BMI$C$3”), by selecting the
   variables in the **Variable Tree**, clicking **Preview**, and then
   clicking **Make Output** (Figure :ref:`fig.sinter.excel.variableoutput`).

#. The simulation is now set up. To save the configuration file, click
   **Finish** or press CTRL+S. The file is saved to the location that
   was set on the SinterConfigGUI Simulation Meta-Data window. A user
   can save a copy under a different name, by navigating back to the
   SinterConfigGUI Simulation Meta-Data window using **Back**, and then
   changing the name. This creates a second version of the file.
