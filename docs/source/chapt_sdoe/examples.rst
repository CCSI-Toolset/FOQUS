Examples
========

Next, we illustrate the use of the SDOE capability for several different scenarios. Example 1 constructs several uniform space filling designs of size 8 to 10 runs for a 2-dimensional input space based on a regular square region with a candidate set that is a regularly spaced grid. Both minimax and maximin designs are constructed to illustrate the difference in the criteria.
Example 2 takes one of the designs created in Example 1, and considers how it might be used for sequential updating with additional experimentation. In this case the Example 1 design is considered as historical data, and the goal is to augment the design with several additional runs.

Example 3 considers a 5-dimensional input space based on a CCSI example, and demonstrates what the process of Sequential Design of Experiments might look like with several iterations of constructing uniform space filling designs.
