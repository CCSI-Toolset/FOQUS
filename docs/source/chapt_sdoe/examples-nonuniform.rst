Example 1: Constructing Non-Uniform Space Filling maximin designs for a 2-D input space
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this first example, the goal is to construct a non-uniform space-filling design with 10 runs in a 2-dimensional space 
based on a regular unconstrained square region populated with a grid of candidate points.
