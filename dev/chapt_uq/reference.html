<h1>Reference<a class="headerlink" href="#reference" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) module of FOQUS provides a multitude
of analysis and visualization capabilities to facilitate the
understanding of uncertainty’s impact on a given system. In a generic UQ
study, the workflow is usually comprised of the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Define the objectives of the analysis.</li>
<li>Specify and acquire the simulation model, which implements an
input-to-output mapping from inputs to outputs.</li>
<li>Select the inputs that have uncertainty and characterize said
uncertainty in the form of <em>prior</em> distributions.</li>
<li>Identify relevant data from physical experiments that can be used to
refine these prior distributions on the inputs.</li>
<li>Generate a set of input samples according to the input distribution.</li>
<li>Propagate the set of input samples through the simulation model to
get the corresponding output values.</li>
<li>Analyze the results to make informed decisions about subsequent
analyses.</li>
</ol>
<p>FOQUS UQ provides tools to perform Steps 5-7. With respect to Step 7, a
variety of analysis capabilities are available. They include parameter
screening methods, response surface construction/validation/prediction,
uncertainty analysis, sensitivity analysis, and visualization.</p>
<p>In this chapter, components of the UQ user interface are first
explained, then the use of these components for UQ analyses is
illustrated.</p>
<div class="section" id="uq-user-interface">
<h2>UQ User Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#uq-user-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The UQ module enables the user to perform UQ studies on a flowsheet.
From the Uncertainty button on the Home window, the user can configure
different simulation ensembles (different sets of samples generated
using different sampling schemes), run them, and perform analyses. This
screen is illustrated in Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:uq_screen">[fig:uq_screen]</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id1">
<img alt="Uncertainty Quantification Screen" src="../_images/1_UQScreen2.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Uncertainty Quantification Screen</span></p>
</div>
<p>[fig:uq_screen]</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Simulation Ensemble Table</strong> displays all of the simulation
ensembles: each ensemble being a row in the table. A simulation
ensemble is a collection of sample points where each sample point has
a different set of values for the uncertain variables. The values of
these variables are generated based on the sampling scheme designated
by the user. When launched, the output values of the sample points
are calculated based on the generated sample input values.
Subsequently, the corresponding simulation outputs can be analyzed.
For each ensemble, the table displays the <strong>Ensemble</strong> index, <strong>Run
Status</strong> (how many have been completed), <strong>Setup</strong> and <strong>Launch</strong>
options (discussed below), and a <strong>Descriptor</strong>. The <strong>Descriptor</strong>
contains the name of the corresponding node in the flowsheet or the
name of the file if the ensemble was loaded from a file. Additional
sample information such as <strong># Inputs</strong>, <strong># Outputs</strong>, <strong>Sample
Design</strong>, and <strong>Sample Size</strong> are also displayed on the right.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Add New</strong> creates a simulation ensemble (a set of input samples)
as a new row in the <strong>Simulation Ensemble Table</strong>. Once clicked, a
dialog is displayed to prompt the user to choose between using (1)
a flowsheet (an exact simulation model) or (2) a response surface
(an approximate simulation model or an emulator) associated with
the ensemble.</div>
<div class="line">If using an emulator, the user must browse a PSUADE-formatted file
that contains the training data for the emulator (in this version,
the response surface type has been designated inside the sample
file and can only be changed by editing the sample file) and select
the output(s) to be evaluated by the trained emulator.
Subsequently, a simulation setup dialog box is displayed for
setting up the distributions of input variables and the sampling
scheme to generate samples of the uncertain input variables. This
<strong>Simulation Ensemble Setup</strong> dialog is explained in further detail
in Section <a class="reference external" href="#subsec:uq_simsetup">1.1</a>.</div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Load from File</strong> loads a simulation ensemble from a sample file
that conforms to the PSUADE full file format. (See Section
<a class="reference external" href="#ap:psuadefiles">[ap:psuadefiles]</a> for details on the PSUADE full
file format.) The user can click <strong>Save Selected</strong> to save an
existing ensemble as a PSUADE full file, and load it by clicking
<strong>Load from File</strong> to perform further analyses.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Clone Selected</strong> clones the selected simulation ensemble and adds
the copy as a new row at the end of the table. This ensemble can then
be edited (e.g., depending on whether the ensemble has been run, the
user has different options for modifying the ensemble). This allows
the user to create a new ensemble similar to the current ensemble
without having to start from scratch (i.e., setting up the input
parameters). For example: (1) <strong>Clone Selected</strong> can be used in
conjunction with <strong>Load from File</strong> to clone an existing ensemble
before input/output modification to prepare a new but similar
ensemble for UQ analysis. (2) <strong>Clone Selected</strong> can also be used to
prepare a fresh ensemble for evaluation via a different simulation
model. In this case, the user should save the cloned ensemble, reload
it by clicking <strong>Add New</strong>, associate it with a node, and then click
<strong>Launch</strong> to start the runs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Delete Selected</strong> deletes the currently selected simulation
ensemble.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Revise</strong> enables a user to change a simulation ensemble before
launching the run. If the ensemble was previously run or it is cloned
from an already-generated sample, the corresponding button becomes
<strong>View</strong> so the user can view the input samples in the simulation
ensemble.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Launch</strong> starts the simulation process of the ensemble. (<strong>Launch</strong>
is not enabled until the user has setup everything needed for
simulations.) A simulation is launched for each sample point to
compute the corresponding outputs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Analyze</strong>, when enabled (after all simulation results are ready),
enables the user to perform various UQ analysis to the ensemble. When
clicked, a new dialog box displays, allowing the user to configure
and run analysis.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Data Manipulation</strong> enables (1) the deletion of inputs, outputs, or
samples, (2) the modification of output values for specific sample
points, and (3) the range-based filtering of samples.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Inspection/Deletion/Output Value Modification</strong> serves three
purposes: it enables the user to (1) view the numerical values of
samples in table form, (2) delete variables and/or samples, and (3)
edit the output values of specific samples. <strong>Deletion</strong> creates a
new simulation ensemble as a new row in the simulation table that
contains only those inputs/outputs and samples that were not selected
for deletion. <strong>Output Value Modification</strong> changes the values within
the ensemble itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Filtering</strong> enables the user to filter samples based on the values
of an input or output. First, select the ensemble to be filtered from
the <strong>Simulation Ensemble Table</strong>. Once filtering is complete, a new
simulation ensemble is added as a new row in the simulation table.
The new simulation ensemble contains only those samples that satisfy
the filtering criterion (with input or output samples within the
specified range).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Reset Table</strong> resets the table to default, meaning all variable and
sample selections are unselected and output values within the table
are reverted back to their original values, thus undoing any edits to
the table.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The table displays the values of inputs and outputs for each sample.
Inputs are highlighted in pink; outputs are highlighted in yellow.
The user can select which variables (columns) to delete by selecting
the checkboxes on top. Likewise, the user can select which samples
(rows) to delete by selecting the checkboxes on the left. Multiple
samples can also be selected/deselected by using (1) Shift+Click or
Ctrl+Click to select multiple rows, or (2) right-clicking to bring up
a menu to check or uncheck the checkboxes corresponding to the rows
of the selected samples. In addition, the user can change any output
value by editing the appropriate cell. These modified cells are
highlighted green until changes are made permanent by clicking the
appropriate button.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Perform Deletion then Save as New Ensemble</strong> creates a new
simulation ensemble as a new row in the <strong>Simulation Ensemble
Table</strong>. The new ensemble is without the variables and samples that
were previously selected for removal.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Make Output Value Changes Permanent</strong> overwrites the output values
in the current ensemble with those that are highlighted green in the
table.</p>
<p>The <strong>Filtering</strong> tab is illustrated in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:uq_deltab">[fig:uq_deltab]</a> and enables the user to filter
samples based on the values of an input or output.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id2">
<img alt="Filtering Tab" src="../_images/2_FilteringTab2.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Filtering Tab</span></p>
</div>
<p>[fig:uq_deltab]</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Filter Input</strong> filters based on the value of a certain input.
Select an input variable as the filter target, and enter the lower
and upper thresholds to specify a range of values to be kept in the
new ensemble.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Filter Output</strong> filters based on the value of a certain output.
Select an output variable as the filter target, and enter the lower
and upper thresholds to specify a range of values to be kept in the
new ensemble.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Once the filter settings are set, click <strong>Perform Filtering then Save
as New Ensemble</strong> to apply the filter and create a new simulation
ensemble.</p>
<p>The single-output <strong>Analysis of Ensemble</strong> dialog, which is displayed
when <strong>Analyze</strong> is clicked for the selected ensemble, has two modes,
as shown in Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:uq_analysisW">[fig:uq_analysisW]</a> and
Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:uqt_rsaeua">[fig:uqt_rsaeua]</a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Analysis Dialog, Ensemble Data Analysis, Wizard Mode</span></p>
</div>
<p>[fig:uq_analysisW]</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Select <strong>Wizard</strong> or <strong>Expert</strong> mode. The <strong>Wizard</strong> mode provides
more detailed guidance on how to perform UQ analysis. For users
familiar with UQ analysis techniques, the <strong>Expert</strong> mode provides
more functionality and flexibility but with less guidance on its use.
For example, users will be able to customize the input distributions,
as well as run more advanced uncertainty analysis that handles both
epistemic and aleatory uncertainties.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>Analyses Performed</strong> section provides the user a history of
previous analyses that were performed. The results of these analyses
are cached, so the user can plot the analysis results without having
to recompute them.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>Analysis Table</strong> populates as the user performs analyses. It
lists previous analyses that the user has performed, along with some
of the main analysis settings (analysis type, inputs and outputs
analyzed, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Depending on the type of analysis performed, the <strong>Additional Info</strong>
button displays any additional settings or parameters set by the user
in the selected analysis that were not shown in the <strong>Analysis
Table</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>Results</strong> button will display the results of the selected
analysis.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>Delete</strong> button will delete the selected analysis from the
history of previous analyses. Once deleted, the user will need to
perform the analysis again to see its results.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>Qualitative Parameter Selection</strong> (top part of the <strong>Analysis
of Ensemble</strong> dialog) houses the controls for parameter selection
analysis. Parameter selection is a qualitative sensitivity analysis
method that identifies a group of dominant input parameters that are
recommended for inclusion in subsequent UQ analyses, as they are the
ones that most impact the output uncertainty. The parameter screening
results are shown as bar graphs so that the user can rank the
uncertain parameters visually.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Before performing parameter selection, the user must select a single
output for identifying parameter sensitivities from the <strong>Choose
output to analyze</strong> drop-down list.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There are several methods of parameter selection. The list of
parameter selection methods available depends on the sample scheme of
the selected ensemble. Select the appropriate method from the
<strong>Choose Parameter Selection Method</strong> drop-down list. Then click
<strong>Compute input importance</strong> to start the analysis.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>Ensemble Data</strong> radio button directs FOQUS to perform analyses
on the raw ensemble data.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To view plots of the raw ensemble data, choose the desired input(s)
from the <strong>Select the input(s)</strong> drop-down lists. Then click
<strong>Visualize</strong>. If multiple inputs are selected, each must be unique.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To perform an analysis, select the desired analysis (“Uncertainty
Analysis” or “Sensitivity Analysis”) from the <strong>Choose UQ Analysis</strong>
drop-down list. Uncertainty Analysis computes and displays the
probability distribution of the single selected output parameter and
displays its sufficient statistics, such as mean, standard deviation,
skewness, and kurtosis. Sensitivity Analysis computes and displays
each uncertain input parameter’s contribution to the total variance
of the output. If Sensitivity Analysis is selected, choose the type
of sensitivity analysis desired in the next drop-down list. There are
three options for Sensitivity Analysis: (1) first-order, (2)
second-order, and (3) total-order.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First-order analysis examines the effect of varying an input
parameter alone.</li>
<li>Second-order analysis examines the effect of varying pairs of
input parameters.</li>
<li>Total-order analysis examines all interactions’ effect of varying
an input parameter alone and as a combination with any other input
parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click <strong>Analyze</strong> to run the analysis. (Note: Raw ensemble data
analysis may not be suitable if the sample size is small. It may be
useful if the data set has tens of thousands of sample points or if
an adequate response surface cannot be constructed. Otherwise,
response surface-based analyses are recommended.)</p>
<div class="figure" id="id4">

</div>
<p>[fig:uq_analysisW2]</p>
<p>[itm:uq_analysis]</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Response Surface</strong> enables the user to perform all analyses related
to response surfaces. A response surface is an approximation of the
input-to-output relationship. This is an inexpensive way to
approximate the values of outputs given different input values when
the actual simulation of output values is computationally intensive.
FOQUS uses the data (i.e., input-output samples) to fit a response
surface scheme. The first step in this analysis is to select which
output to analyze.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Select the <strong>Response Surface Model</strong> to be used to approximate the
input-to-output mapping. Selection of “Polynomial” or “MARS” requires
one further selection in the second drop-down list. If “Polynomial”
is chosen in the first drop-down list and “Legendre” is chosen in the
second drop-down list, the user needs to specify a number for the
<strong>Legendre polynomial order</strong> before analysis can proceed.
[itm:uq_rs]</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The response surface selected must be validated before further
analyses can be performed. The user can specify the error envelope
for the validation plot. When <strong>Validate</strong> is clicked, the resulting
plots display the best fit between the response surface (based on the
model selected) and the actual data.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Choose UQ Analysis</strong> enables the user to perform
response-surface-based UQ analyses. Select the analysis in the first
drop-down list. If the desired analysis is Sensitivity Analysis,
select the desired type of sensitivity analysis in the second
drop-down list and then click <strong>Analyze</strong>. <strong>Uncertainty Analysis</strong>
and <strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong> compute and display the same quantities
as in item #<a class="reference external" href="#itm:uq_analysis">[itm:uq_analysis]</a>. However, the
results displayed are based on samples drawn from the trained
response surface, not the simulation ensemble itself. Moreover, if
the selected response surface has uncertainty, the resulting plots
also reflect this uncertainty information.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">FOQUS also provides visualization capabilities, enabling the user to
view the response surface as a function of one or multiple inputs. Up
to three inputs can be visualized at once. Click <strong>Visualize</strong> to
view. A 2-D line plot displays if only one input parameter is
selected. A 3-D surface plot and a 2-D contour plot display if two
input parameters are selected. A 3-D isosurface plot with a slider
bar displays if three input parameters are chosen. For the isosurface
plot, the user can use the slider to selectively display the 3-D
input parameter space that activates a particular range in the output
parameter.</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>Bayesian Inference of Ensemble</strong> dialog (shown in
Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:uq_inf">[fig:uq_inf]</a>) is used to calculate the
posterior distributions (prior distributions integrated with data) of
the uncertain input parameters. Inference utilizes Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) to compute the posterior distributions, using response
surfaces that serve as fast approximations to the actual simulation
model.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id5">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Bayesian Inference Dialog</span></p>
</div>
<p>[fig:uq_inf]</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Inference uses a response surface to approximate the input-to-output
mapping. In <strong>Output Settings</strong>, select the observed outputs and
select the response surface type that works best with each observed
output. As in item (<a class="reference external" href="#itm:uq_rs">[itm:uq_rs]</a>), further selections
may be required based on the response surface chosen. The simulation
ensemble is used as the training data for generating the response
surfaces.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The user can specify which inputs are fixed, design (fixed per
experiment, but changes between experiments), or variable using the
<strong>Input Settings Table</strong>. In addition, the user can specify which
inputs are displayed in the resulting plots of the posterior
distributions. By default, once inference completes, all inputs will
be displayed in the plots. To omit specific inputs, clear the
checkboxes from the <strong>Display</strong> column of the table. Finally, in
<strong>Expert</strong> mode, this table can also be used to modify the input
prior distributions. The default prior is the input distribution
specified in the simulation ensemble. To change the prior
distribution type, use the drop-down list in the <strong>PDF</strong> column and
enter corresponding values for the PDF parameters. To change the
range of a uniform prior, scroll all the way to the right to modify
<strong>Min/Max</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>Observations</strong> section enables the user to add experimental
data in the form of observations of certain output variables. At
least one observation is required. Currently, the observation noise
model is assumed to be a normal distribution. Other distributions may
be supported in the future. To specify the observation noise model,
enter the mean (and standard deviation, if standard inference is
selected) for each output observation. For convenience, the <strong>Mean</strong>
and <strong>Standard Deviation</strong> fields have been populated with the
statistics from the ensemble uncertainty analysis. If any inputs are
selected as design inputs, their values will also be required here.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Save Posterior Input Samples to File</strong> checkbox, when selected,
saves the posterior input samples as a PSUADE sample file (format
described in Section <a class="reference external" href="#ap:psuadefiles">[ap:psuadefiles]</a>). This
file characterizes the input uncertainty as a set of samples, which
can be re-used in the <strong>Simulation Ensemble Setup</strong> dialog, to
evaluate the outputs corresponding to these posterior input samples.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If saving posterior samples to a file, click <strong>Browse</strong> to set the

<li><p class="first">Click <strong>Infer</strong> to start the analysis. (Note: If the inference
returns an invalid posterior distribution (i.e., one with no
samples), it usually means the prior distributions or that the
observation data distributions are not prescribed appropriately. In
this case, it is recommended that the user experiment with different
priors and/or data distribution means and/or standard deviations.)</p>

run to completion, use Replot to generate new plots (e.g., to only

<p>The <strong>Simulation Ensemble Setup</strong> dialog (shown in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:uq_sim_dist">[fig:uq_sim_dist]</a>) is used to create a new
simulation ensemble. This is done by: (1) setting up distribution
parameters and generating samples, or (2) loading samples from a file.
This dialog is displayed when selecting <strong>Add New</strong> on the UQ window
(Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:uq_screen">[fig:uq_screen]</a>).</p>

<li><p class="first">Choose how to generate samples. There are three options: (1) <strong>Choose
sampling scheme</strong> (default), (2) <strong>Load flowsheet samples</strong>, or (3)
<strong>Load all samples from a single file</strong>. The option 3 is explained in
item (<a class="reference external" href="#itm:uq_sim_last">[itm:uq_sim_last]</a>). [itm:uq_sim_first]</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If <strong>Choose Sampling Scheme</strong> is selected, the <strong>Distributions</strong> tab
is displayed. The user specifies the input uncertainty information.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The <strong>Distributions Table</strong> is pre-populated with input variable
information gathered from the flowsheet node. Under the <strong>Type</strong>
column drop-down list, the user can select “Fixed” or “Variable”.
Selecting “Fixed” means that the input is fixed at its default value
for all the samples. Changing the type to “Variable” means that the
input is uncertain; therefore, its value varies between samples. With
any fixed input, the only parameter that can be changed is the
<strong>Default</strong> value (i.e., all samples of this input are fixed at this
default value). With any variable input, the <strong>Min/Max</strong> values, as
well as the probability distribution function (<strong>PDF</strong>), for that
input can be changed. Some PDFs have their own parameters (e.g., mean
and standard deviation for a normal distribution), which are required
in the columns right of the distribution column. See the PSUADE
manual for more details on the different PDFs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>All Fixed</strong> and <strong>All Variable</strong> are convenient ways to set all the
inputs to variable or fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Note: A “Sample” PDF refers to sampling with replacement (i.e., input
samples would be randomly drawn, with replacement, from a sample
file). If the selected distribution for any input is “Sample”, then
the following parameters are required: (1) the path of the sample
file (which must conform to the sample format specified in Section
<a class="reference external" href="#ap:psuadefiles">[ap:psuadefiles]</a>); (2) the output index that
designates which output is to be used.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In the <strong>Sampling scheme</strong> tab (Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:uq_sim_samplescheme">[fig:uq_sim_samplescheme]</a>), specify
the sampling scheme, the sample size, and perform sample generation.</p>

<li><p class="first">Each radio button displays a different list of sampling schemes on
the right. The radio buttons serve as a guide to help in the
selection of the appropriate sampling schemes for target analyses. A
sampling scheme must be selected from the list on the right to
proceed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Set the number of samples to be generated from the <strong># of samples</strong>
spinbox.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When all parameters are set, click <strong>Generate Samples</strong>. This
generates the values for all the input variables, based on the
sampling scheme selected.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Once samples have been generated, click <strong>Preview Samples</strong> to view
the samples that were generated. This displays the sample values in
table form, as well as graphically as a scatter plot.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">From item (<a class="reference external" href="#itm:uq_sim_first">[itm:uq_sim_first]</a>), if the user
elects to load all samples from a single file, click <strong>Browse</strong> to
select the file containing the samples (Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:uq_sim_loadsample">[fig:uq_sim_loadsample]</a>). This file must
conform to the PSUADE full file format, the PSUADE sample format, or
CSV file (all formats described in Section
<a class="reference external" href="#ap:psuadefiles">[ap:psuadefiles]</a>). Note: This is the only place
where all the formats are supported. Once the file is loaded, the
file name displays in the text box. These samples can now be used in
the same way as an ensemble that was newly generated (as described
above).</p>
