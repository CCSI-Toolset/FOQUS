Efficient Implementation of Experimental Run Order
==================================================
  
Once designs have been created, it is often important to optimize the run order to efficiently reach equilibrium and 
allow for the maximum number of runs to be implemented within a constrainted budget or time period. While statisticians 
generally recommend using a randomized order for the experimental runs, it can sometimes mean the difference of a small 
randomized experiment versus a larger non-randomized experiment.

In this section we describe how to generate an efficient run order for a design created using the Uniform Space Filling or 
Non-Uniform Space Filling design options.
