Example 1: ODoE with Existing Candidate Set
--------------------------------------------

In this example, the user will provide an existing candidate set.

#. Start FOQUS and click the ‘SDoE’ icon.

#. Click the **Browse** button to **Load RS Train Data**, browse and load the ODoE_example.csv
   from the examples folder.

   First you will be prompted to specify the number of inputs in your
   training data.

   After clicking **OK** the file loads and the screen will look like this:

#. Under **Input Setup** we need to select the type for each input. Leave **X1** and **X2** as **Variable**
   inputs and change **X3** and **X4** to be **Design** inputs.

#. Click **Confirm Inputs** and the **Simulation Ensemble Setup** window will pop up to generate
   our **Prior Sample**.

#. Switch to the **Sampling Scheme** tab and select **Monte Carlo** and leave the **# of Samples**
   at **1000**. Click **Generate Samples**. When the samples are generated, **Done!** will show up
   right next to the button. You can visualize the samples clicking on the **Preview Samples** button.
   Once the user is done, click the **Done** button so the generated samples get saved.

   Browse and load the CandidateSet.csv from the examples folder. The user can select the candidate
   and click on the **Delete Selection** button in case they want to delete the candidate set. To
   visualize the data, just click the **View** button under the **Visualize** column.

#. On the right hand side of the **Design Setup** section, click on the **Load Evaluation Set**
   button.

   Browse and load the EvaluationSet.csv file from the examples folder. Similar to the candidate set
   section, the user can select the evaluation set and click on the **Delete Selection** button in
   case they want to delete the evaulation set. To visualize the data, just click the **View**
   button under the **Visualize** column.

#. Click on the **Confirm Design Setup** button and under the **Output Setup** section, select
   **MARS** in the **Response Surface** dropdown menu.

#. Click **Validate RS** button and the user will get a informative message window and the response
   surface validation plot.

   If the RS selected looks good, you can click the **Confirm RS** button. The response surface
   predictions on candidates will get populated in the table on the bottom right corner under
   **RS Predictions on Candidates**. The user can edit the **mean** and **standard deviation**
   columns in this table as needed.

#. Under ODoE Setup select the **Optimality Criterion** (in this case G-Opt), **Design Size**
   (in this case 2) and **Number of Restarts** (in this case 3).

   The choice of optimality criterion to use for design construction is driven by the objectives of the
   experimenter. If the primary focus of the experimenter is parameter estimation, then selecting the D-
   or A-optimality criterion is recommended. If the primary objective of the experimenter is precise
   prediction of the response of interest, then it is best to select the G- or I-optimality criterion.
   In this case, the experimenter was primarily interested in response prediction, so the G-optimal
   criterion was selected. Likewise, Design Size and Number of Restarts should be selected to best serve
   the needs of the experimental objectives. A larger design will allow more information to be collected
   than a smaller design, but will necessitate the use of more time and other experimental resources.
   The choice of design size is often dictated by the size of the experimental budget. Furthermore, the
   choice of Number of Restarts involves a trade-off between the quality of the design generated and the
   time to generate the design, with more restarts typically resulting in better designs. In this example,
   both design size and number of restarts were selected to fit within the given budgetary and time
   constraints of the experimenter.

   Once those three parameters are decided, click the **Run ODoE** button. A window with PSUADE running
   will show up.

#. Once PSUADE finishes generating the optimality-based design, another window will pop up with
   results information. A more thorough summary will also be saved in the **ODOE_files** directory
   as **odoe_results.txt**.
