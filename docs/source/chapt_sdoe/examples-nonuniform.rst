Example NUSF-1: Constructing Non-Uniform Space Filling maximin designs for a 2-D input space
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this first Non-Uniform Space Filling design example, the goal is to construct a non-uniform space-filling design with 15 runs in a 2-dimensional space based on a regular unconstrained square region populated with a grid of candidate points. As noted previously in the Basics section, in addition to specifying the candidate point input combinations, it is also required to supply an additional column of weights. This column will provide the necessary information about which regions of the input space should be emphasized more, and which should be emphasized less.
