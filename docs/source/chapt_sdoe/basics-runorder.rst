Efficient Implementation of Experimental Run Order
==================================================
  
Once designs have been created, it is often important to optimize the run order to efficiently reach equilibrium and 
allow for the maximum number of runs to be implemented within a constrainted budget or time period. While statisticians 
generally recommend using a randomized order for the experimental runs, it can sometimes mean the difference of a small 
randomized experiment versus a larger non-randomized experiment.

In this section we describe how to generate an efficient run order for a design created using the Uniform Space Filling or 
Non-Uniform Space Filling design options.

Once we create a design (USF or NUSF), the design appears on the left panel. We click on the design we want to order (it turns highlighted as shown below. Then we find the button below named "Order Design" and it becomes active. Clicking this button will order the design points and a pop up window will confirm the location of the file with ordered design (see below).
