# These will override requirements picked up from setup.py below:

# - pinning the Pylint version to ensure reproducible behavior and defaults
# - also pinning the version for Astroid (used by pylint to analyze the AST)
#   since there can be significant differences between (non-major) versions,
#   both in terms of behavior and performance
pylint==3.1.0
astroid==3.1.0
