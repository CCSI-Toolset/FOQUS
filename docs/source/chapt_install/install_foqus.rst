Install FOQUS
-------------

.. note::
   In previous releases we instructed you to download the FOQUS code and install it in place.  As
   of version 1.5.0, this is no longer required.  The below ``pip install`` method is now the
   preferred method to install FOQUS.

To install FOQUS, open the Anaconda prompt (or appropriate terminal or shell depending on operating
system and choice of Python), and run the following commands::

    conda activate ccsi-foqus
    pip install ccsi-foqus

This will install FOQUS and all the required packages into the ``ccsi-foqus`` conda environment.
