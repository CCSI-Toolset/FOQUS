Tutorial 1: Aspen Custom Modeler (ACM) Configuration
====================================================

The files (both the ACM and the JSON files) for this tutorial
are located in: **examples/test_files/Optimization/Model_Files/**

.. note:: |examples_reminder_text|

#. The “SinterConfigGUI” can be launched from FOQUS, via the
   **Create/Edit** button found in **Session**\ :math:`\rightarrow`
   **Add/Update Model to Turbine** or “SinterConfigGUI” may be run on
   its own by selecting **SimSinter** :math:`\rightarrow`
   **SinterConfigGUI** from the Windows Start menu.

#. The splash window displays, as shown in Figure :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.splash`. The user may
   click the splash screen to proceed, or wait ten seconds for it to
   close automatically.

#. The SinterConfigGUI Open Simulation window displays (Figure
   :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.openpage`). If “SinterConfigGUI” was opened from FOQUS,
   the filename text box already contains the correct file. To proceed
   immediately click **Open File and Configure Variables** or click **Browse**
   to search for the file. For this tutorial, the ACM model (``BFBv6.2.acmf``)
   for a bubbling fluidized bed adsorber (located in the
   ``examples/test_files/Optimization/Model_Files`` folder) is selected. Once
   the file is selected, click **Open File and Configure Variables**. The user
   can open a fresh ACM simulation (.acmf file) or an existing SimSinter
   configuration file. For this example, open a fresh simulation.

   .. note:: Opening the simulation may take a few minutes depending on how
             quickly Aspen Custom Modeler can be opened.

#. Aspen Custom Modeler starts in the background. This is so the user
   can observe things about the simulation while working on the
   configuration file.

#. The SinterConfigGUI Simulation Meta-Data window displays. (Figure
   :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.savename`). The first
   and most important piece of metadata is **SimSinter Save Location**
   at the top of the window. This is where the sinter configuration file
   is saved. The system attempts to locate a reasonable file location
   and file name; however, the user must confirm the correct file
   location, since it automatically overwrites whatever file name
   currently exists.

#. In the **SinterConfigGUI Variable Configuration Page**, (Figure
   :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.variableempty`)
   notice that the ACM **Selected Input Variables**: **TimeSeries**,
   **Snapshot**, **RunMode**, **printlevel** and **homotopy** are
   already included in the input variables. **TimeSeries** and
   **Snapshot** are for dynamic simulations. **RunMode** can be either
   “Steady State” or “Dynamic”. The Dynamic mode requires a dynamic ACM
   model. For this simulation, the RunMode is Steady State. The
   **homotopy** variable can be set to “1” so that homotopy is on by
   default. Notice that the **Dynamic** column (the first column) in
   each row contains a checkbox, enabling the user to select if the
   input variable in the row is a dynamic variable. Also notice that a
   **Variable Type** search box is on the left. This search is exactly
   the same as Variable Find on the Tools menu in Aspen Custom Modeler.
   Please refer to the ACM documentation for details on search patterns.

#. A search for everything in the “BFBAdsT” block has been selected. The
   following **Search in Progress** dialog is displayed (Figure
   :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.variableprogress`).
   Sometimes large searches take a while.

#. First, select the “BFBadsT.A1” scalar variable in the **Selected
   Path** field (Figure :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.variableselected`).

#. If the user double-clicks, presses Enter, or clicks **Preview** or
   **Lookup**, information displays in the **Preview Variable** section
   (Figure :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.variablepreview`).
   Here, the user can verify the variable choices.

#. “BFBadsT.A1” is the correct variable; therefore, click **Make
   Input**. Information displays in the **Selected Input Variables**
   section (Figure :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.variableinput`).

   .. figure:: ../figs/acm/09_VariablesInput.png

#. Change the variable name from “BFBadsT.A1” to something more
   descriptive (e.g., “WaterA”). Set **Name**, **Description** and
   **Min/Max** as shown in Figure :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.variablename`.

#. One input variable is now displayed (Figure :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.vectorpreview`).
   At least one output variable is required. In this example, the vector
   of calculated bubble sizes is wanted. Scroll down under **Search**
   and select “BFBadsT.db.Value,” “BFBadsT.db.Value(0),”
   “BFBadsT.db.Value(1),” etc. If a name with a number in parenthesis at
   the end is selected, it is a specific entry in the vector. If a basic
   name is selected (“BFBadsT.db.Value”), the entire vector is
   displayed. Select the whole vector and click **Preview**.

#. Click **Make Output** if the variable the user wants is selected.
   Notice that this variable has a unit “m” (Figure 
   :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.vectoroutput`).

#. Change the **Name** of the variable to “Diameter.” Bubble size is
   measured in meters; however, meters should be converted to
   millimeters (mm). Now, the output from the simulation should present
   bubble diameter in mm (Figure :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.vectorunits`).
   Internal to the simulation, the unit remains “m.”

#. To add a single item in a vector, select “BFBadsT.Ar.Value(1)” and
   click **Make Input** (See Figure :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.vectorremoval`).
   To remove item that was just added, select it and click **Remove
   Variable**.

#. Select the correct variable vector “BFBadsT.Ar.Value” and make it an
   input (Figure :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.vectorreadd`).
   Notice that a **Default** or **Min/Max** cannot be set in the GUI for
   a vector. The correct defaults (from the simulation) are set
   automatically. To change the **Min/Max** values, the user must edit
   the JSON file in a text editor.

#. Click **Next** to display the SinterConfigGUI Vector Default
   Initialization window as shown in Figure 
   :ref:`fig.sinter.acm.vectorinput`. Since
   the input variable “Value” is a vector, its default values can be
   modified in the window. In this case there is no need to change the
   values.

#. The simulation is now setup. Save the configuration file by clicking
   **Finish**. The file is saved to the location specified on the
   SinterConfigGUI Simulation Meta-Data page. Clicking **Finish** will
   close the SinterConfigGUI, but NOT Aspen Custom Modeler. The user
   must close ACM manually.

#. If “SinterConfigGUI” was launched from FOQUS, the path to the
   configuration file is automatically passed to FOQUS. The next step in
   FOQUS is to click **OK** in the Add/Update Turbine Model window.
   FOQUS may then be used to upload it to the Turbine gateway. If
   “SinterConfigGUI” was not launched from FOQUS (e.g., it was launched
   from the Start menu), the configuration file name must be entered in
   FOQUS manually.
