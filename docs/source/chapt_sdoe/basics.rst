Using the SDoE Module - The Basics
==================================

In this section, we will describe the basic steps in for creating a design with this module. We give details for the
Uniform Space Filling Design, Non-Uniform Space Filling design and finally Input-Response Space Filling Design.


When you first click on the  **SDOE** tab from the main FOQUS homepage, a first window appears. To create a design, the
progression of steps takes you through the **Design Setup** box (top left), then a transition triggered by the **Continue**
button to the **Design Construction** box, and finally there are optional changes that can be made in the box at the
bottom of the window. The final step in this window is to click on which type of design do you want to construct
**Uniform Space Filling**, **Non Uniform Space Filling**, or **Input-Response Space Filling**.
