"""foqusALAMOClient.py

* The purpose of this scrip is to be the simulator executable for
* ALAMO.  It reads the input data from ALAMO sends it to FOQUS using
* a network socket connection, waits for the results and writes them
* in the format expected by ALAMO, then it closes the listener in
* FOQUS and exits.
