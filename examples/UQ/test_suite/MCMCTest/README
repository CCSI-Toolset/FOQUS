Problem:

- Read the simulator.c file.
- This program outputs the differences between the simulator
  outputs and data (in mcmcFile, see below)

mcmcFile contains the data:
- (1 4 0) means 1 experimental data set, 4 outputs, no design parameter
- line 2: experiment number, output 1 mean, output 1 std dev, output 2 mean,...
- need to be enclosed by PSUADE_BEGIN and PSUADE_END

PSUADE takes the 4 outputs (differences between observations and simulation)
and creates a likelihood function using information in mcmcFile. 

PSUADE runs MCMC given priors and the likelihood function.

==============================================
Steps to run:

- create simulator: cc -c simulator simulator.c -lm
- run psuade: psuade psuadeRS.in
- rename psuade output file: mv psuadeData psData
- launch psuade without any argument
  psuade
  > load psData
  > rsmcmc
  ...
  enter: mcmcFile
  > quit
- Use matlab to view matlabmcmc2.m
==============================================
The steps have been captured by psScript.in

just run: psuade < psScript.in
