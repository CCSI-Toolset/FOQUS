\section{DMF Integration}
\label{sec.tut.simsinter.dmf}

To provide a smoother workflow within the CCSI toolset, SimSinter is integrated with the
Data Management Framework (DMF). When the DMF is setup, SimSinter
provides the option to upload simulations directly to the DMF
(see Figure~\ref{fig.sinter.dmf.upload}). For more information on how to setup the DMF,
please refer to section~\ref{dmf-setup}.
