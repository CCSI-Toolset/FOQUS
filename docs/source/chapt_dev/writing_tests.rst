Writing tests for FOQUS
=======================

This section contains tutorials and How-To recipes for writing tests for the FOQUS test suite.

.. note::

   The main development goal of the FOQUS test infrastructure (including the ``pytest_qt_extras`` plugin for writing GUI tests)
   is to present a concise, intuitive API (Application Programming Interface),
   that makes it easier for developers to write tests with a syntax that's closer to a plain English description.

   If you encounter something that you find not intuitive, or have any other feedback on how the plugin could be improved,
   please feel free to open an issue (or a PR) with your suggestions.
