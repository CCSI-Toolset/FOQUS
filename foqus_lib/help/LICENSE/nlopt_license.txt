In general, the different code in NLopt comes from different sources,
and have a variety of licenses. For example, all of the new code we 
wrote for NLopt is under the MIT License (which imposes essentially 
no practical restrictions, and is hence compatible with the LGPL). The
combination of all of this software is under the conjunction of the 
license terms, and in particular they are limited by the most 
restrictive of the licenses for the portions, which in this case is the 
LGPL. (The other portions of NLopt are under LGPL-compatible, 
less-restrictive licenses like the MIT license. So, if you remove the 
LGPL portions, which are currently code by Ladislav Luksan, the 
remainder reverts to a looser license.)
