Using the SDoE Module - The Basics
==================================

In this section, we will describe the basic steps in for creating a design with this module. We first give details for the Uniform Space Filling Design, and then give a second set of details for a Non-Uniform Space Filling design. 


When you first click on the  **SDOE** button from the main FOQUS homepage, a first window appears. To create a design, the progression of steps takes you through the **Ensemble Selection** box (top left), then a transition triggered by the **Confirm** button to the **Ensemble Aggregation** box, and finally there are optional changes that can be made in the box at the bottom of the window. The final step in this window is to click on which type of design do you want to construct **Uniform Space Filling**, **Non Uniform Space Filling**, or **Input-Response Space Filling**.
