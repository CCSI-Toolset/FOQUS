## FOQUS can’t find PSUADE, what should I do?

FOQUS looks for PSUADE using the PSUADE path. To find out which PSUADE file FOQUS is using, go to the “Settings” button at the top of the Home window.
Make sure the path in the PSUADE EXE entry matches the path of your PSUADE executable in your system.


## When setting up the variables in the Optimization Under Uncertainty (OUU) module, I want to load my own sample for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) variables Z3 and/or Z4. How should I proceed?

Under the UQ Setup tab, select load existing sample for Z4 (or Z3 if applicable).
Click the 'Browse' button and find the correct sample file. Make sure your file is in the correct format.
