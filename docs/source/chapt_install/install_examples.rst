Install FOQUS Examples
----------------------

.. note::
   In previous releases the examples were packaged inside the main ``ccsi-foqus`` package.
   Since version 3.5.0, they are no longer part of the ``ccsi-foqus`` package, but instead distributed as a separate archive.
   The steps described below are now the correct method to install the FOQUS examples.

To obtain the FOQUS examples, go to the "Releases" section of the FOQUS code repository on GitHub at `<https://github.com/CCSI-Toolset/FOQUS/releases>`_,
and locate the release of interest based on the version number.

Then, expand the "Assets" section.
The examples are packaged in a ZIP archive named ``cssi-foqus-X.Y.Z-examples.zip``,
where ``X.Y.Z`` is the FOQUS version number.

Finally, download the archive containing the example, and extract it to a directory of your choice on your system.
Throughout the rest of this documentation, we will refer to this directory as the **Examples directory**.
