Contact and Support
-------------------

There are multiple ways to contact the development team, get support, file a
bug, make a feature request and even contribute code changes to FOQUS:

- Send a private email to ccsi-support@acceleratecarboncapture.org for
  contacting an internal set of developers.

- Subscribe to and send an email to our ccsi-users@acceleratecarboncapture.org
  public discussion forum to ask a question of the existing user base.

- Use any of the public GitHub features:

  - Read or start a new `Discussion <https://github.com/CCSI-Toolset/FOQUS/discussions>`_

  - Open a new `Issue <https://github.com/CCSI-Toolset/FOQUS/issues>`_ if you
    believe you've found a bug (please include detailed steps on how to
    reproduce the error, including if possible, screenshots and log files.)
    This is also where you can make feature requests.
